### Manually Updating AdNauseam on a Chromium Browser

1. **Backup your AdNauseam data** (optional but recommended): Follow the steps here: [Backup Your Data](https://github.com/dhowe/AdNauseam/wiki/Install-AdNauseam-on-Chromium-based-browsers#backup-your-data).  
2. **Locate the existing installation folder**:  
   - Go to **Manage Extensions** > **AdNauseam** > **Details**.  
   - Find the **Source** locationâ€”it shows the folder where AdNauseam is installed.  
3. **Download the latest version**:  
   - Get the latest [adnauseam.chromium.zip](https://github.com/dhowe/AdNauseam/releases/latest/download/adnauseam.chromium.zip) from the [releases page](https://github.com/dhowe/AdNauseam/releases/latest).  
4. **Extract and replace**:  
   - Unzip the file and move the extracted `adnauseam.chromium` folder to the existing installation location, replacing the old files.  
5. **Reload the extension**:  
   - Go back to **Manage Extensions** and toggle **Developer Mode** on (if not already).  
   - Click **Reload** on AdNauseam.
