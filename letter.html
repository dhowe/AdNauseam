<h3>HELP KEEP ADNAUSEAM ALIVE!</h3>
<p>
To keep AdNauseam running, we’ve partly relied on academic funding and regulatory initiative to
maintain the project and stay up to date in the ongoing battle against the advertising and tracking
industry, and now the race to dominate generative AI.
</p>

<p>
    The current political shift in the US has vested industry with even greater powers than before,
    explicitly rejecting any moves to regulate “Ai.” The race to scrape more, and more data, to surveil
    and profile individual behavior is unfettered and brazen. Regulatory forces that might have listened
    are silenced by aggressive efforts of industry to halt resistance. In fact, the very forces of politics that
    may have come to our rescue, seem happier than ever to exploit the powers of inference and
    profiling to keep track of and control us.
</p>

<p>
    At the same time, the US is turning against academia and has cut sources of funding that have
    supported progressive and innovative efforts such as ours.
</p>

<p>
We know we are not alone. The vision we hold onto of online space, freed from oppressive,
exploitative watchers, fuels our effort, even against these odds. With a shoestring budget and zero
marketing, we have been amazed and gratified by our growing numbers and generous contributions
in kind and currency. (Some of the best ideas have come from you, our users.)
</p>
<p>
    But now, we kindly need to ask for your help as a community to help keep AdNauseam strong. Your
    contributions function in two ways: 1) as a signal of your solidarity with our aims; and 2) to put bread
    on the table for our intrepid coders.
