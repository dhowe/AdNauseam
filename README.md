[AdNauseam](https://adnauseam.io) is a lightweight browser extension that blends software tool and artware intervention to actively fight back against tracking by advertising networks. AdNauseam works like an ad-blocker (it is built atop [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock)) to silently simulate clicks on each blocked ad, confusing trackers as to one's real interests. At the same time, AdNauseam serves as a means of voicing your discontent with advertising networks that disregard privacy and engage in bulk surveillance.

In light of the industry's failure to address the excesses of network tracking, AdNauseam allows individual users to take matters into their own hands, offering active defense against surveillance, profiling and potential discrimination. The software thus represents a similar approach to that of <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/trackmenot" target="_blank">TrackMeNot</a>, relocating power in the hands of individual users, rather than vast commercial entities. For further information on this approach, please see <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/trackmenot/resources/trackmenot2009.pdf" target="_blank">this paper</a>.
